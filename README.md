## Summary
This is my pet project - my take on a terraform visualizer. 

To use:
- Paste the output of your terraform output `terraform show -json`
- Get a detailed risk analysis.
- For AWS resources, get a cost estimate of the resources plan. Note that the costs are static and may not be up to date.
